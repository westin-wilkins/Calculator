Calculator

The Calculator program is a simple application written in C++ that defines and uses a Calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations. It provides a convenient way to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers while gracefully handling errors and invalid inputs.

Features:
    Addition: Add two numbers together.
    Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
    Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
    Division: Divide one number by another.

Error Handling:
The Calculator class is designed to handle various errors and invalid inputs gracefully. It ensures that dividing by zero or providing non-numeric values as input does not result in program crashes or undesired behavior. Instead, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user, indicating the nature of the error and guiding them to provide valid inputs.
